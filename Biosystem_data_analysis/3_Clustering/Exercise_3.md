### Q1ï¼šWhat can you say about this data? Which variables are able to distinguish between groups?

This data set has a very clear clustering property. The Petal.Width is able to distinguish between groups.

### Q2: How good is this clustering? Which species are not well clustered? Conclusion on rand index and adjusted rand index?

This clustering is pertty good, since the rand index is nearly 1. From the clustering table, it is easy to see that 'Virginica' is not well clustered.

The adjusted rand index should be more accurate than rand index. Since it cancles out the impact of randomness.

### Q3: ...?

It is obvious that sample 1, 2, 4 are selected as cluster centers.

The Euclidean distance is preferable. Because it has the largest adjusted rand index.

### Q4: How can you interpret this dendrogram? What can you learn from it?

The samples with low height have close relationship between each other, on the contrast, the Euclidean distance between samples with higher heights are far.

What I can learn is that 'versicolor' and 'virginica' are close to each other, while 'setosa' is far from them.

### Q5: ...

...

### Q6:

WTF is happening?

### Q7:

For random data set, hierarchical clustering would generate a lot of random clusters, and the adjusted rand index would be very small.

### Q8:

I still have no fucking idead about how to interpret these fucking graphs

### Q9:

This graph shows how the weight of each cell change because of each variable.

### Q10:

I have no idea

### DO IT YOURSELF:

The groups that are nicely seperated in SOM are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10
