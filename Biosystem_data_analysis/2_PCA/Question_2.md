### Q2: Which is the best normal distribution?

My conclusion is that with log transformation, the data shows normal distribution best.

### Q3: What is the reason of the difference between ssq_raw and ssq_log?

I have no idea

### Q4: Explain what you see and interpret

What I see is that the first principal component of raw data represents most of the variation compared with the second PC, and the residuals are relatively low, which means the unexplained fraction of variation is relatively small. However, for the log transformed data, we did not see significant differences of variance on the first PC and second PC. Also, the residuals are pretty high, so there are plenty of unexplained variation.

### Q5: What is strange for this individual?

I have no idea :(

### Q6: How many PCs would you choose?

3, because with 3 PCs we have the smallest PRESS value
